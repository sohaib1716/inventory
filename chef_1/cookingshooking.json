Just as you like it!"}],"recipeNotes":"Notes:\nDo not proceed to make the bread if the yeast mixture is not frothy, or else your bread will not proof.\nMilk powder will make the bread very soft and tender.\nUse a cooker which has height and which can accommodate the size of your bread tin. This will ensure even cooking.\nIf you do not have a round ring you can use a wired stand, katori, cookie cutter or a bowl to elevate the height.\nUse a serrated knife to slice the bread, do to not use the regular knife.\n\nTips:\nNever add salt directly to the yeast mixture it will kill the yeast and will not activate.\nTo make good dough your dough needs to have lots of moisture and it has to be very soft, almost paste like.\nBrushing the bread with milk, will ensure that you get the brown colour on top. Milk has natural fat and sugar which helps in the browning. You can also use sweet water.\nIf the bread is under risen it will crack and over risen then it will deflate.\nLow flame means, more cooking time and dry bread and High flame means, less cooking time and very moist bread.\n","searchTags":["bread recipe in cooker","bread without oven","how to make bread without oven"],"dir":"/","path":"/bread-in-cooker-recipe-no-oven-homemade-white-bread","extension":".json","createdAt":"2020-11-15T19:44:59.181Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-15T19:44:59.181Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1605469589069},"$loki":32},{"updated":1592909851604,"content":"Hey Foodies,<br /><br />Congratulations to all of us, 2 Years back, 23rd June was a normal day to us..

Go and get one, why because its awesome! Ohk, let me explain a tit bit of the setup i was talking about in the video.<br /><br />Basically, you keep a perforated plate over the flame(Heavy Duty one!) then comes the coal. Then keep a grill stand and above that the tawa. Then cover this with a big kadhai/pan which is actually very big and if using a kadhai, use the one which has no handles, something like <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/search?q=dekchi&amp;espv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=uJEQ_Cux-ZN7TM%253A%253Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fencrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com%252Fimages%253Fq%253Dtbn%253AANd9GcTuFD6ymiAtPoMYGDzwehxCdhbm2fHamKnRswud7L3gugNH47UQ%253B4608%253B2592%253BP6QYXRUsZyJU9M%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fcommons.wikimedia.org%25252Fwiki%25252FFile%25253AKadai_and_a_dekchi.JPG&amp;source=iu&amp;usg=__m-kctJOySyfBr6jHu0XM2oEYEcw%3D&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eJKqU5DVE82cugS7noCwBA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB0Q9QEwAA&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=912#facrc=_&amp;imgrc=uJEQ_Cux-ZN7TM%253A%3BP6QYXRUsZyJU9M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fupload.wikimedia.org%252Fwikipedia%252Fcommons%252F0%252F0b%252FKadai_and_a_dekchi.JPG%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fcommons.wikimedia.org%252Fwiki%252FFile%253AKadai_and_a_dekchi.JPG%3B4608%3B2592\">this</a>. It should cover everything. Yes, a bit confusing.. So, on my take, almost everyone has a gas tandoor or a microwave with convection, bake in that as this way is a bit confusing.. All the best! :)<br /><br />Believe me or not, this bread was so awesome that we ate two loaves in a day! YES! We're not a bread fan, but there's something awesome in homemade breads!

So today we will make these meetha paan with a slight variation, the basic ingredients will be the same, but with the addition of chocolate and hazelnut paste will take it to another level. Begin by trimming and washing the paan leaves and then apply a good amount of hazelnut paste, top it with all the sweet goodies like moth freshener, saunf, tutti frutti, desiccated coconut and not to forget the secret ingredients chocolate chips. Fold it and seal it,  then comes the most delicious part, dipping the paan in some melted chocolate and serving it cold. Enjoy this meetha paan after a hearty meal."}],"recipeNotes":"Notes:\nPlacing the trimmed paan leaves will avoid the breaking of the paan while shaping.\nYou can use katha paste, lime stone or chunna instead of hazelnut paste, incase if you are making regular sweet paan for adults.\nYou can use small saunf / fennel seeds.\nPlease use very small quantity of peppermint, it has a very strong flavour and if used in excess then it can make your paan bitter. You can replace the peppermint to peppermint candy like polo.\nAvoid using the watery liquid from the gulkand, only use the solid part.\nWhile shaping the paan, hold the paan tightly.\nA double boiler is nothing but heating a vessel on top of another vessel which has water in it.\nYou can prepare the paans beforehand and keep it in the fridge and they can stay upto 24 hours.

But can get tricky when making without oven. Here are a few points for you to look at. The size and height of the tin matters. Make sure the height of the cake tin is no more than 2\". You want the pavs when prooved to be parallel or above the tin's height for them to brown well inside the cooker. \n Flame: The flame that we use to bake cakes is low-med quite on the low side. But for baking these pavs, you need to have the flame in med-high. Quite on the higher side.   \n Browning: A good brushing of milk is usually enough for it. But, if you are not confident whether they will brown well or not, you can add a pinch of sugar and mix the sugar in the milk and then brush the pavs. The sugar will help in browning much better. But be careful, too much sugar can lead to over-browning/burning. Just a pinch is good. Make sure to remove the gasket/rubber thing of your pressure cooker. As the heat is going to be quite on the higher side, be careful. And I will suggest using old salt. I mean, use salt that you have used earlier to bake something else.","postTags":["without oven"," homemade"," indian pav bread recipe"," ladi pav recipe"," pav bun recipe"," soft"," how to make bread without oven"," pressure cooker"," bread buns dinner roll recipe"," bread in pressure cooker"," buns without oven"," eggless bread without oven"," eggless dinner roll"," eggless ladi pav in cooker"," eggless ladi pav without oven"," eggless pao"," feather soft"," how to make bread in cooker"," ladi pav"," make pav at home without oven"," pav bhaji"," pav in pressure cooker"," pav recipe without oven"],"title":"Eggless Ladi Pav Without Oven - Feather Soft Buns Recipe In Cooker - Eggless Baking Without Oven","cookTime":"16 min.","publish":true,"youtubeUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sD_gDptMnY8","recipeSteps":[{"group":{"name":"","steps":[{"text":"To the warm milk, add the sugar and the yeast.

So to reduce the hassle, I skipped it the fourth time, and it was still great :) If you are a person who likes eating chicken pieces in a dish with a hand, you would like the kurkuri thing in the dish. Also in the dish at the restaurant, it was loaded with black cardamons &amp; cloves...

Perfect round miniature boondis simmered in sugar syrup! Make and enjoyy.. :) This was again a recipe, that took a lot of time and effort to develop.. Specially more effort.. Finally, one day tried making with thin batter and it came great! So, definitely takes some effort but is out of the world! That's it for today..<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Yaman","recipeSteps":[{"group":{"steps":[{"text":"Start by mixing the besan, a pinch of kesar food color, ¼ tsp ghee in a bowl. Add water little by little and make a batter. Keep aside some of the water(if measured as shown), or make a medium thin batter using water as required. Let the batter rest for 15-20 minutes minimum."},{"text":"Add more water and make a super thin, “Watery” kind batter. Heat ghee to fry the Motichoor boondis, in a kadhai/pan."},{"text":"You’ll need a Jhara for making the miniature boondis, the finest one. Place a stand/container or some sort of thing near the pan with ghee. Make sure to keep a cloth below and above the container. The height of the container should be a couple inches above the pan."},{"text":"On the other side, keep a plate/tray where you’ll keep the fried boondis in. Above the plate, either keep a strainer or a colander so that the excessive ghee can come out. To make these miniature boondis, its advisable to have someone help you."},{"text":"To make these, you’ll need to consistently beat/hammer/tap down your jhara’s handle in the container and the face of jhara should be over the pan. While someone who is helping you would add a ladle full of the watery batter. And the miniature boondis would fall into the super-hot/little less hot than smoky ghee."},{"text":"As soon as you feel all the batter has been dropped into the hot ghee, take the boondis out from the ghee. I mean instantly take them out. You don’t want to over cook them, they’re smaller than a mustard and would cook in a second as the ghee is super hot as well. Keep the fried boondis over a colander/strainer."},{"text":"Like so, make the miniature boondis by smashing/hammering down the jhara’s stem/long handle over the container while someone adds a ladle full of batter to it and the boondis would fall into the super hot ghee and it’ll fry in a jiffy. Take them out and place in the strainer. Keep taking the boondis out from the strainer and keep in a bowl so that all boondis get a chance to leave the excess ghee."},{"text":"After all the boondis are made, let them rest for 10-15 minutes."},{"text":"To make the syrup, add the 180grams of sugar and 90ml of water in a pan. Add a pinch of kesar food color, a pinch of Cream of Tartar/Tartari and the rose water."},{"text":"Heat it up and let the sugar dissolve, and switch over to a very very low flame. If your stove doesn’t have a very slow flame, switch off the flame. The flame should be such low as its closed to being switched off."},{"text":"Add the boondis in and start stirring it. Cooking these boondis is a critical and tricky step, if you cook this less it won’t form into laddos and even if it forms it may remain kinda chewy and wet. If you cook it more, it’ll be hard and all the goodness of a melt in mouth motichoor would be void."},{"text":"Cook it in very very low flame, just until it starts leaving sides. If you had switched off flame, switch it on after 2 minutes to the lowest flame and Cook it till Just Starts Leaving Sides. Once done, switch off flame and cover and let it be like so for 5-6 minutes."},{"text":"Take the mixture out from the pan into a plate and spread it. Add the char magaz/melon seeds and let it cool down completely. You have two options; either make the laddus and keep them for 4-5 hours or let this mixture rest for 4-5 hours then make the laddus. I make as soon as it cools, then let them rest. I prefer to shape and then rest."},{"text":"Shape these into laddus and then cover these and let these rest for 4-5 hours minimum. More the better, but one cannot resist any more. By this time happens, the boondis get softer, sweeter and just like a motichoor laddo should be."},{"text":"As the time passes, and if you had made them before and let them rest which may result in slight odd shapes, you can roll them between your Ghee Greased/Wet Palms again to make them round and shiny. ENJOY!"}],"name":""}}],"title":"Motichoor Laddo Recipe | Perfect Motichur Laddus - Indian Sweet Secrets Revealed","totalTime":"5 hrs. 50 min.","recipeNotes":"TIPS / Tricks / Do’s and Don’ts:\n\nBesan: For this recipe let me explain. Basically you need a coarse besan. Bombay Besan and the Normal/Coarse Besan are the normal two kinds. Bombay Besan is a fine variety of besan, usually used in the fritters. And the coarse variety which is ground coarse, especially used for Mithais, such as this, besan ki burfi, laddo and so on. Try to find the coarse variety and use it, if unable to you could try replacing 1 1/2 tbsps of besan from 1 cup of besan with semolina/suji. Though, its best to find a coarse variety that is easily available. \n\nThe thickness of Batter: Plays an important Role, Make sure the batter is of watery consistency. It Should Not Be Thick. If it's thick, the jhara’s holes may get jammed or the batter may get a little collected beneath the holes resulting in thicker/bigger boondis. On the other hand, it should not be way too diluted, it should have a like consistency. \nConsistency in Tapping: Make sure you tap/hammer your jhara’s long handle in the container/stand consistently. If you do it slowly, you may get a Fried Pancake or Lumps of Boondi / Large Boondis.\n \n*DO THIS UNDER ADULT SUPERVISION IF YOU’RE NOT AN ADULT LIKE I DID.* \nBe patient, and don’t rush there’s smoky hot ghee which you’re working with.\n\nFrying the boondis : These motichoor boondis are even smaller and mustard and the ghee is as hot as it would smoke which means as soon as it goes to the ghee it gets cooked in a jiffy. Make sure you take them out instantly. Also, make sure you let the boondis get rid of excess ghee. And time to time transfer the boondis to a bowl so that all the boondis are excess-ghee-free.\n\nThe syrup: As soon as the sugar melts transfer to a very very low flame and add in the fried motichoor boondis. For the moti(s) to choor you need to cook them in such a way that they absorb the syrup and get soft. I presume, the mithaiwalas make in a large quantity which means the syrup cools down tremendously and then takes a good time and the boondis get cooked well and soak the syrup well. At home, you need to either switch off the flame and add the boondis and after two minutes turn it on to the lowest flame or place it in such a flame that it is close to the flame being switched off. My hob has a very small burner I used that. Cooking this mixture till such that it starts leaving sides may turn these laddos dry, which motichoors aren’t. So you need to use something acidic, which will prevent the crystallization/drying of it. You can use a drop of lemon juice or citric acid or a tiny pinch of cream of tartar or as popularly known in hindi as “tartari”. One way of testing whether the cooking in syrup is done or not is by “grabbing a boondi and pressing/trying to choor the boondi.” If it choors well its ready. \n\nNote: The known texture of super soft and melt in mouth is going to come with time. The boondis of the motichoor laddo would go even softer and as found in shops as you keep it to rest, it is kinda firm when you shape it. \n\nThe final wait: You need to either keep the mixture for quite a time like for 4-5 hours or shape the laddus then keep them for at least 4-5 hours. This does many things; Mingles the flavors; Makes the boondies super soft and melt in the mouth and just like available in the market which now maybe a little firm; laddos would get sweeter.","author":"Yaman Agarwal","prepTime":"30 min.","slug":"motichoorladdo","youtubeUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GwroC8kFGOk","dir":"/","path":"/motichoorladdo","extension":".json","createdAt":"2020-11-15T19:44:59.193Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-15T19:44:59.193Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1605469589093},"$loki":147},{"id":7192,"recipeIngredients":[{"group":{"name":"For the dough","ingredients":[{"ingredient":"Warm water","quantity":"1/2 cup"},{"ingredient":"Sugar","quantity":"1 tbsp"},{"ingredient":"Instant Yeast","quantity":"1 tsp"},{"quantity":"1/2 cup Rajgira, Bajra, Ragi & Soya","ingredient":"Mixed Grain Flour"},{"quantity":"1/2 cup","ingredient":"Wheat Flour / Atta"},{"ingredient":"Salt","quantity":"to taste"},{"ingredient":"Olive oil","quantity":"2 tbsp Saffola Aura"},{"quantity":"as required for kneading","ingredient":"Warm water"}]}},{"group":{"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"Red Capsicum","quantity":"1 large"},{"quantity":"4-5 cloves ","ingredient":"Garlic"}],"name":"For the Sauce"}},{"group":{"ingredients":[{"quantity":"2-3 tbsp","ingredient":"Maize Flour / Corn Meal"},{"ingredient":"Olive oil","quantity":"1 tbsp for greasing the tray"},{"ingredient":"Olive oil","quantity":"1 tbsp on the pizza base"},{"quantity":"50 gms grated","ingredient":"Mozzarella Cheese"}],"name":"For assembling "}},{"group":{"name":"For the toppings","ingredients":[{"ingredient":"Sliced Onion","quantity":"as required"},{"ingredient":"Black Olives","quantity":""},{"ingredient":"Sliced Green Bell Peppers","quantity":""},{"quantity":"","ingredient":"Babycorn"},{"quantity":"","ingredient":"Marinated Soya"},{"ingredient":"Corn","quantity":""},{"ingredient":"Sliced Tomatoes","quantity":""},{"quantity":"","ingredient":"Garlic Flakes"}]}},{"group":{"name":"For sprinkling","ingredients":[{"quantity":"1 tsp","ingredient":"Garlic Powder"},{"ingredient":"Pizza Herbs","quantity":"1 tsp"},{"quantity":"1 tsp","ingredient":"Chili Flakes"}]}}],"recipeIntros":[{"text":"Hey Foodies,\nWho can resist the aroma of freshly baked pizzas in the oven.

These days Microwaves come with Convection Mode which is meant for baking.. Convection is nothing but Fan-Forced Baking, which means there is a fan which circulates the air inside the oven. While this is normal in High-end-OTGs, Built in Ovens, Gas Ranges and so on, which makes the baking happen faster and even.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake8.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2262\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake8.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"mwcupcake8\" width=\"1923\" height=\"1080\" /></a><br /><br />The scenario is somewhat different in this case, there is only one source of heat, the heating rods are either in top of the Microwave or in the sides.. Which makes the food cook faster from the top/side and slower from beneath, even with the convection/fan forced heating. Yes, this might not happen with each and every Microwave with Convection, but does happen with mine, one more i tested in, and many of you said as well.

So have a blast and go all out this Diwali!","imageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cscom-2019.appspot.com/uploads/2018/11/kalakand.jpg"}],"recipeNotes":"Notes:\nStirring the milk continuously is very important; if you burn the milk then the whole kalakand will not be edible to eat.\nKeep stirring and scrap the sides of the kadhai so that you avoid the milk from sticking or burning at the bottom of the pan.\nUsing the citric acid all at once will ruin the kalakand and will make it chewy in texture.\nAdding the sugar all at once will separate the milk and the milk and the curdle solids will be chewy.\n\nTips:\nUse full cream milk for this recipe for an absolute perfect kalakand.\nClean the iron kadhai with citric acid, and ensure that there is no oil in the kadhai.\nKalakand is always served unshaped, because it takes long to set.\nWe cannot keep the kalakand in the fridge to set. It will change the taste and texture. Allow the kalakand to set naturally for atleast 24 hours.\n","searchTags":["diwali sweet recipes","how to make kalakand","indian milk cake recipe","indian sweets","kalakand milk barfi recipe","kalakand using milk"],"title":"Perfect Kalakand Recipe – Fresh Indian Milk Cake Halwai Style Diwali Special – CookingShooking","cookTime":"45 mins","publish":true,"youtubeUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q3DM9LyShmM?autoplay=1","id":8585,"recipeSteps":[{"group":{"steps":[{"text":"Preheat a deep iron kadhai over high heat, pour the milk.","stepImageUrl":"https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Step-1-1-300x153.jpg"},{"text":"Over high heat, bring the milk to a boil and continuously stir the milk.","stepImageUrl":"https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Step-2-300x147.jpg"},{"text":"In a small bowl combine the citric acid with water.

Most of my failed attempts are due to the milk.. It has to be Pure!<br/>Sugar - Sugar quantity depends upon the pot size. The ratio of sugar water i prefer is 1:5. <br/>Chenna - It has to be dry but also should have a little amount of moisture. If the chenna is dry, rasgullas will be dry/will dilute with syrup. If it has much of moisture, rasgullas will be flat/dilute/crack.. <br/>Kneading - Follow this simple rule, knead until it starts leaving the fat/ghee! Once you feel the plate and your hands are getting greasy, make balls and cook!<br/>Rasgulla Size - You can make them smaller or big, its up to you! Ideal size if 1 inch diameter when raw. It'll be double in size when cooked!<br/>Sugar Syrup - You need atleast 4\" or more of deepness of sugar syrup in the pot you are using for making this to ensure they remain round while cooking. Pot's width should atleast be 10 inches. <br/>Sugar Syrup should be continuously boiling while they are cooking!<br/>You can clean the sugar syrup if you want crystal clear sugar syrup. To do so, add 2 tablespoon of milk to boiling sugar syrup. Remove the scum which will float in just another 10 seconds. And then cook the rasgullas.<br/>You can use any pot with a lid. Ideal size of pot for 8 rasgullas: 10 Inch Width 6-8 Inches Height! You can cook upto 10 rasgullas in this big cooker and this much syrup.

But make sure it is a thick paste and kind of gloopy. Then mix it as best as you can, while doing it you'd see the the batter kind of flowing more now. After mixing for about 5 minutes, you'll it is flowy, stringy, sticky and if you keep for a couple of seconds idle air bubbles will come up to the surface. It is not a strict recipe, i mean like baking recipes you can wet your hands and mix it if its way too thick or add a tsp of flour if its way too thin. Consistency should be such that it is flowy but thick. Have you seen a halwai making these? How he presses the cloth and batter flows in a flowy stream, and when he stops it stops. I like to add baking powder, so the jalebis puff a little in the oil and also get a little more crispy. You can use baking soda but, as it is more alkaline than baking powder jalebis will brown more. I like to have them slightly golden rather than brown spots. Both ways it should work well! You can use 1 cup of jaggery and 1 cup of sugar for syrup if you wish to use jaggery. Before starting to shape jalebis, try to play with the batter and the flame of oil. It should be such that the shape retains and you're able to make a good one. To try it and play with the heat. You need to be quick while taking the jalebis and dunking them in syrup, again be sure to dunk and not coat. Take the jalebis using a tong and dunk them in using a skimmer. One more recipe, that I said would share here: Make sugar syrup using the 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water, food color, and a pinch of cream of tartar/one lemon wedge as shown in the video. Take 70 grams of maida, add 30 grams of urad flour(powder it in your mixer and sieve and add in 1/4 tsp each of citric acid and baking soda. Add sufficient amount of water to make a thick batter. Transfer the batter to a disposable piping bag or a ketchup bottle or zip lock bag, and pipe jalebis in 1/2\" oil as shown in the video. Cook the jalebis in medium hot oil until golden, dunk in the syrup as shown. And take out in 5-6 seconds. Serve Hot. This way also makes good jalebis but I feel the consistency is not good and also they can get soggy. Most of the time they are soggy when taken out from syrup and then they turn crunchy after 3-4 minutes from out like melting moments cookies. These are good, but I like the rangkat one better. I just shared this as well, because I know some people might not be able to find the rangkat and would ask for a recipe without it so shared :) But trust me, You'll be able to find rangkat, in any wholesale grocery store.. Just go to your city's hyped wholesale market and ask for rangkat, or hydro or jalebi ka powder..:) Just try finding at least 2-3 times, and not only in your regular grocery store, in the wholesale market or baking supply stores. I got it from Chawla Essence Mart, General Bazar in Hyderabad.","title":"Jalebi Recipe - Perfect Recipe Crispy Out, Syrup Inside, Foolproof Instant - Traditional Indian Sweets Halwai Secret","publish":true,"cookTime":"10 Minutes","youtubeUrl":"https:/www.youtube.com/embed/_wuJYFCN9P8","recipeSteps":[{"group":{"name":"","steps":[{"text":"Start by making the syrup for this for which take a saucepan and add the 2 cups of sugar, about 3/4 a cup of water and heat this up in medium flame."},{"text":"Stir occasionally until the syrup gets a roaring boil, and the sugar is all dissolved.

A small thread should form also the syrup would be sticky, the syrup is ready. If its forming a thick thread and more than one, add about 2-3 tbsp water to the syrup to get it back to a less than a single thread consistency. Switch off the flame and let it cool while we'll make the batter. Remove the lemon wedges after its warm."},{"text":"To make the batter, take about 1/3 cup of water and then add the rangkat hydro and then add the flour. Using hands, form this into a thick paste kind of batter. Add 2 more tbsp water if required be careful with the water amounts or else it would be very watery and flow-y. Once it is formed into a thick paste kind of batter, mix this in a rotating motion for about 5 minutes. This will turn from this thick paste kind to a batter that is thick, but flows like a liquid, and is exceptionally smooth and is kind of stringy if you touch your finger and pull back. This is what we want, this smoothness(aka chikna) and the flowy consistency while being thick."},{"text":"Also, all the agitation you did will bring a lot of air into the batter which is great!

Instant ways as well, using yeast, using baking soda and powder, using baking soda and citric acid, using fruit salt, using urad dal which turns into a lil kind of imarti.. But no luck, Its not like I mean these methods aren't good or any recipe is bad.. I've tried making these all ways, but the results were not as i expected them, maybe I had expected more than i should.. The basic problems in most ways is the jalebis are either soft. they turn soggy after keeping in syrup, turns limp, is chewy, jalebis dont take syrup in, is flat, is bread like, is yeasty and crunchy like hell as well!<br />So you must be thinking, what makes it perfect? What is the thing that makes it good? It is Hydro, also known as Rangkat or Rangkat Hydro. Upon researching, found it is Sodium Hydrosulfite / Sodium Dithionite. Which is a vat reducing / bleaching agent as a technical grade product.  But this is used in food industry as a preservative and also in sweets for which a food-grade is sold i believe. And In India, this is a common ingredient used by Halwais, but it is kept to themselves. Easily available in Wholesale Grocery Stores and Bakery Supply Stores. Chances are almost none that your nearby-retail store or supermarket would carry this. I also found this <a href=\"http://honestyshop.in/index.php?id_product=639&amp;controller=product\">link while researching from where you can buy this, I am in no-way related to this website. If you are doing any transaction, please do it in your risk.</a> I bought from my bakery supply store. And if you have made or are able to make jalebis, Hats off and Salute to you! Seriously, it isn't easy to make and perfect these! So, Hats off and Salute! :)<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2FJalebi6.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2235\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2FJalebi6.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"Jalebi6\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1078\" /></a><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />What is the role in the recipe? Just a pinch of this is very powerful in its work. What does it do? Well, we basically take a pinch of it, add to a cup of flour add water and make a thick batter. Then beat it, the agitation helps in incorporating air to the batter. Also while this turns from a very thick paste kind batter to a free-flowing smooth(kind of slang but \"chikna\") batter. The consistency is difficult to explain, but have you seen a halwai making jalebis? The batter flows in a stream when he presses the batter, and stops the flow when he does.. This is what it does, the consistency is such it is flow(y) yet thick. A leavener is added to ensure they puff a tad bit and also get crispier. What it does it makes the batter super smooth, thick yet flowy and eliminates the step to ferment the batter. To make the jalebis, its important to have the smoothness, and the thick yet flowy consistency which this Hydro gives.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2FJalebi4.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2233\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2FJalebi4.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"Jalebi4\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1078\" /></a><br /><br />A few months earlier, I was talking to one vendor who has multiple stores, he said, \"hum log to pehle wale batter me aur maida daal ke banate hain har roj.. and so on..\" Translate: We make it by mixing more flour to the last day's batter which works as a culture/starter.. Which runs like a chain from years to them, something like we make yogurt. I then asked whether if he can share some of his batter and the way he makes? He shared! I brought the batter and first saw the consistency, and there i was amazed to see thick yet flowy.. It was stringy as well, like if you put your finger in and pull it back string forms and was a little sticky and extremely smooth and chikna.. Then i made jalebis with it, they were awesome.. I was happy to make them, though i dint make the batter.. Then i made the batter the way he said, 1 kilo maida me 200g dahi mila ke thoro pani dal ke fet ke rakh do, jaise rat ko 10 baje banaya to kal 2 baje jalebi banagi. (mix 1kg flour, 200g yogurt and water as required. make a batter and beat. then keep for fermenting). I did the same way, but it din't work. It wasn't at all the way his batter looked and feel like and even taste like. Still i made jalebis and but they were not good.. Some were chewy and bread like and some were soft and limp..<br /><div>He said, making jalebi is easy if you have a culture from last day.</div><br /><div></div><br /><div>The way he said to make these, dint work for me but the batter he gave me changed the way i was looking forward to make jalebis.. I was aiming to achieve the same batter, which led to this Hydro which makes this happen. And trust me, his batter did have this i can guarantee that. He din't share that (why would he?)..</div><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2FJalebi3.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2232 aligncenter\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2FJalebi3.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"Jalebi3\" width=\"760\" height=\"1080\" /></a><br /><br />After thinking a lot and researching, I got to know about the magic ingredient and, after that I've been getting perfect jalebis everytime! They're crisp, they are succulent, they are not extensively chewy, they don't get soggy and best of all they're way better than the market ones and not to forget this is an Instant Recipe YAY for that.. You can whip this up anytime you wish requires no yeast, no fruit salt, no fermentation :D !
